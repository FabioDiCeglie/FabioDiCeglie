Hey 👋

I’m Fabio, I’m a software engineer here to make people happy, one line of code at a time. 

In “my previous life”, I worked as a chef  including Michelin star restaurants, where I learned to lead teams and deliver high-quality results with meticulous attention to detail for very high demanding customers. 

In my current life, I bring the same passion to the digital world, specializing in Web Engineering, AI and Cloud Engineering. 
To consolidate my skills I attended multiple specializations around Cloud Platforms, Databases and UX Design. I strongly believe in value-driven and Customer-centric Design approach that prioritizes customer satisfaction while aligning with strategic business goals.
